hello everyone and welcome back to my channel Jennifer Marie where I teach you different ways to make money online and also teach you about different Tech tips a lot of my videos focus on transcription transcription tools and how to convert audio or video to text so in my last tutorial I taught you how you can convert audio or video files to text completely for free using a virtual audio cable which you can also download for free now this works great but sometimes when you use this method with Google Docs you end up with a transcript like this and while all the words are spelled correctly unfortunately this is missing Correct punctuation so one option is to go through this piece by piece and add Correct punctuation split the sentences but this can take quite a while so you can actually correct this and add all of the punctuation that you need without changing anything by giving the correct instruction with the correct writing prompt to chat GPT so what we're going to do is first of all go to chatgpt and you have to write in this prompt it's very important that you tell chat GPT exactly what you want we're going to say you are a professional transcriptionist you have perfect spelling punctuation and know how to format transcripts correctly I will paste a text for you to correct you will add appropriate capital letters periods commas apostrophes and question marks where necessary and other punctuation marks needed you will not make any other edits to the text you will not change any words you will keep typing until the entire text is punctuated here is the text so now we'll go back to our transcript and press control plus a to highlight the entire thing then Ctrl C to copy go back to Chachi PT we're going to put a quotation mark now Ctrl V to paste and then another quotation mark and now press enter so let's scroll down and you'll see that chat GPT is word for word correcting this entire transcript it is adding appropriate commas it's even adding commas before coordinating conjunctions between two independent clauses some of these are complicated lists and it's added commas correctly it's even adding semicolons between related independent clauses so you can see here that it has used commas correctly quotation marks semicolons colons it's even split these into paragraphs for us and this method is excellent if it's one speaker in your audio or video file or two or more speakers but they are not talking over each other they are taking turns stopped right here after she it almost finished the entire text but we needed to correct a little more of our transcription so do not type in continue press enter because for some reason Chachi PT completely forgets what its assignment was and we'll start writing something that is not related to your transcript so we need to remind it what it's doing and kind of get it to start over so what I would do in this case is try to find where we left off in our original transcript so what we have to do is find a sentence so we have same with the second independent clause it stopped around here so I'm going to highlight that press Ctrl C now we're back in our original document press control plus F to search and then here under find in document control V to paste and make sure to remove any punctuation from the line that you copied because that will not show up in our search since that punctuation has been added in Chachi BT so we know we left off here and we need Chachi PT to finish the rest of this transcript so now we can copy this right here click copy we're going to go back to chat gbt and instead of having it continue here let's start a new chat because sometimes Chachi BT gets confused so under here we're going to paste this and put the quotation marks around it and then we have to paste in the prompt that we already used the first time that you're a professional transcriptionist you have perfect spelling punctuation I recommend keeping this prompt in a notepad or something so you can always easily copy it so I'm going to go to the beginning control V and again we're telling tragic BT what its job is so press enter and so now we simply have to combine these together in a new document so let's go back to Google Docs let's press file new document and we can paste in our original transcript and we can go up here and click on the copy icon to copy all of this and then Ctrl V to paste it and we'll go back to our second transcript again click the copy icon then go back to our Google Docs and Ctrl V to paste it and then we can just merge them together and just like that we have an almost perfect transcript so from here you could go ahead and listen to your audio or video file and just read this and follow along and make any corrections that you need but this is word for word what was in my transcript it's just added all of the punctuation that I needed and I find that using this prompt here that I told you guys about has given me the best results and another thing that you can do that's really cool is you can compare these documents so we could put transcript corrected and let's put original transcript and what we can do is click here on tools compare documents then select the comparison document so let's go to recent and let's choose this one here the transcript that's corrected and click open and then click compare and now we will open the comparison and you can see all of the corrections you can see where they've taken words and added them to new sentences how they've added punctuation how they've broken the sentences correctly so this is a great way as well to make sure that everything is correct in your new transcription so I really hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial I'm having a lot of fun experimenting with chanchi PT and the different possibilities of how we can make our job easier whether or not you are transcribing for a client for yourself for someone you know or just want to use this tool to improve your own punctuation and your own writing or your blog or for your website or your emails or whatever it is so make sure to like this video And subscribe to Jennifer Marie for more videos just like this one
